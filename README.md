# üöó Self-Driving Highway Controller using Model Predictive Control

## The Challenge That Got Us Hooked

Autonomous vehicles are everywhere in the news, but how do you actually make a car drive itself safely on a highway? That's exactly what my team and I tackled in this Advanced Process Control project. We didn't just want to understand the theory - we wanted to build a controller that could handle real-world scenarios like obstacle avoidance, lane keeping, and passenger comfort, all while maximizing performance.

After weeks of mathematical modeling, coding in Python, and debugging optimization algorithms, we ended up with something that genuinely impressed us every time it ran. It's basically the brain behind those self-driving features you see in Tesla and other autonomous vehicles!

## üéØ What Makes This Special

- **üß† Model Predictive Control (MPC)** - Uses predictive optimization to plan the safest, most efficient path
- **üöß Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance** - Smoothly navigates around static obstacles while maintaining safety margins
- **üõ£Ô∏è Intelligent Lane Keeping** - Keeps the vehicle centered in the lane without sacrificing travel time  
- **üòå Comfort-Optimized Driving** - Input rate limiting ensures smooth acceleration and steering (no jerky movements!)
- **‚ö° Real-time Performance** - Fast enough for actual highway speeds (130 km/h max)
- **üìê Kinematic Bicycle Model** - Industry-standard vehicle representation used in real autonomous vehicles

## üõ†Ô∏è The Technical Arsenal

| Component | What We Used | Why This Matters |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Optimization** | CasADi with IPOPT solver | Professional-grade nonlinear optimization for real-time MPC |
| **Vehicle Model** | Kinematic Bicycle Model | Same model used by companies like Tesla and Waymo |
| **Discretization** | Orthogonal Collocation | High-accuracy numerical integration for precise control |
| **Programming** | Python with NumPy, Matplotlib | Industry standard for robotics and control systems |
| **Horizon Tuning** | Adaptive N=3 to N=10 | Balances computational speed with prediction accuracy |

*Total development time: 6 weeks of intensive modeling, coding, and testing*

## üöÄ How This Actually Works

### The Brain (MPC Algorithm)
```python
# Simplified version of our MPC controller
for each_time_step():
    current_state = get_vehicle_state()  # [x, y, heading, velocity]
    obstacles = detect_obstacles()
    
    # Solve optimization problem
    optimal_path = solve_mpc(
        current_state=current_state,
        obstacles=obstacles,
        prediction_horizon=N_steps,
        constraints=[safety_margins, speed_limits, comfort_bounds]
    )
    
    # Apply only the first control input
    acceleration, steering_angle = optimal_path[0]
    vehicle.apply_controls(acceleration, steering_angle)
```

### The Magic Behind the Scenes

**1. Kinematic Bicycle Model**
- Represents the car's physics using just 4 states: position (x,y), heading (œà), and velocity (v)
- Same mathematical foundation used in production autonomous vehicles
- Computationally efficient while maintaining accuracy at highway speeds

**2. Model Predictive Control (MPC)**
- Predicts future vehicle behavior over a time horizon (0.15-0.5 seconds)
- Solves optimization problem to find the best control inputs
- Recalculates every timestep for robust performance

**3. Multi-Objective Optimization**
- **Minimize travel time**: Reach maximum safe speed
- **Lane centering**: Stay in the middle of the lane
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Maintain safety margins around obstacles
- **Comfort**: Limit acceleration and steering rate changes

**4. Safety-Critical Constraints**
- Vehicle footprint approximation (3m√ó2m ‚Üí 1.8m radius circle)
- Obstacle safety margins (1.7m minimum clearance)
- Highway boundaries (never leave the road)
- Physical limits (max acceleration, steering angles)

## üé• See It In Action

Our controller successfully handles:

**Task 1 - Speed Optimization:** Vehicle accelerates from 120 km/h to 130 km/h limit in optimal time

**Task 2 - Lane Centering:** Smoothly corrects from initial y=2.5m to lane center y=2.0m 

**Task 3 - Comfort Driving:** Same performance with smooth acceleration/steering rate limits

**Task 4 - Obstacle Avoidance:** Elegant S-curve maneuver around highway obstacle while maintaining safety

**Bonus - Multiple Obstacles:** Successfully navigates complex scenarios with 3+ obstacles

## üòÖ The Challenges (And How We Conquered Them)

**MPC Tuning Nightmare:** Getting the cost function weights right took forever. Too much emphasis on speed ‚Üí crashes into obstacles. Too much on safety ‚Üí crawls at 50 km/h. The solution: systematic weight tuning and extensive simulation testing.

**Horizon Length Dilemma:** N=3 was too short to avoid obstacles (the car would "see" them too late). N=20 was too slow for real-time. We found N=10 was the sweet spot for highway driving.

**Optimization Convergence Issues:** IPOPT would sometimes fail to find a solution, especially near obstacles. We added terminal costs and relaxed constraints to improve robustness.

**Real-time Performance:** Making sure our controller could run fast enough for actual highway speeds required careful algorithm optimization and efficient CasADi implementation.
